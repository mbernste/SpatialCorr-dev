# Simulation Study

This folder stores the code for simulating spatial UMI counts with spatially varying correlation structure and then analyzing the results.

The pipeline implemented in the Snakemake file generates simulated datasets and runs SpatialDC on these simulated datasets. The notebook `simulation_study_analysis.ipynb` analyzes the results and generates the figures for the paper.
